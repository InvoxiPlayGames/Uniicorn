All required files must go into the "files" directory.

Required files:
* boot0.bin - boot0 dump
* nand.bin - nand dump
* SEEPROM and OTP keys - see below

Key load order:
* otp.bin - raw OTP dump
* seeprom.bin - raw SEEPROM dump
* keys.bin (BootMii format)
* nand.bin (BootMii format)

It is **highly** recommended to have a backup of nand.bin
and seeprom.bin. If using any SEEPROM file other than
seeprom.bin, they will not be modified and a new seeprom.bin
file will appear when the emulated Wii attempts to write to it.
